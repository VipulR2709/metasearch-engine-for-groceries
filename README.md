# Meta-search Engine for Food & Grocery items
*A platform to check and compare grocery prices from different retailers*

## Objective
The goal is to create a database which will have the following information about multiple **food and grocery** items:
 - Product Information (Category, sub-category, etc.)
 - Product availability at different retail stores
 - Price at different stores
 - Stores available within a specific area
 - Substitutes for the required product

A customer with a shopping list will be able to get answers to some sample but not limited to below questions from the final database:

 1. Which are the **nearby retail stores** for me?
 2. **Can I get all the items** that are needed from a single store?
 3. Which store should I buy the items from?
 4. What are the **operational hours** of different stores?
 5. What is the **cheapest option** available?
 6. What is the **fastest option** available?
 7. Is there any **substitute product available** for better pricing?
 8. Do I need to buy different items from different stores?
 9. For a specific store, what are the **public transport options** available?
 10. Considering **a trade-off between time and money**, what's the best option do I have?
 

## Future Scope
An application or website can be developed which can provide users the best options available while considering multiple factors. With having multiple retailers onboard, an option to compare and place an order can be provided to the users which will eventually save the tiresome efforts of checking different websites before ordering.
